# MILILX OS

MILILX OS is a Unix-based operating system that runs on top of MS-DOS, designed for embedded and portable devices. It combines the robustness of Unix-like systems with the compatibility of MS-DOS.

## Features

- **Unix-like Kernel**: Runs on top of MS-DOS, providing a Unix-like environment.
- **Modular Design**: Includes components like a shell, busybox, editor, and bootscreen.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be efficient and suitable for embedded systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MS-DOS or a DOS emulator (like DOSBox).
- A C/C++ compiler or assembler (DJGPP for DOS, or cross-compilers like i386-elf-gcc).
- Tools for building and packaging (like `make`, `dd`, and `zip`).

### Building MILILX

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mililx.git
    cd mililx
    ```

2. **Build the Components**

   To build MILILX on a Unix-like system or in a DOSBox environment, follow these instructions.

   **In Unix-like Environment:**

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
3. **Burn the out `.img` file to a floppy**
4. **Flow the installation instructions**
